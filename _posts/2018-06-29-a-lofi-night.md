There are few places on the internet where wholesome people congregate for wholesome conversation, but I think I found a new one. Ever since the 24/7 lofi hiphop stream on YouTube shut down emotional teenagers looking for a creative outlet have wandered the internet, clicking on every chillwave video hoping to find a familiar hole of feelings in which to fall. The stream was up for a long time, and I remember seeing a bunch of positive comments in the chat. Tonight I found a lofi stream hosted by [the bootleg boy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0fiLCwTmAukotCXYnqfj0A) which can hopefully replace the og stream. A short profile of the chat section:

> "I'm back for another sleepless night and am gonna say what I always say...I'm always here from 12 to 3am for anyone that needs/would like to talk, if not then I'll just be reading my mangas with these beats as background music"

Wholesome

> "I don't listen to this station because i'm sad"

We're all sad

> "Wanna join the sad gang? Me and David are just a few who come back here just to be sad"

More evidence for my future analysis of Sadbois piece.

> "The music is amazing, just a lot of sad in the chat to bond over it haha"

Bonding over sadness is a core tenant of chillwave.

> "But I'd like to think I'd listen to this kinda music if I wasn't [sad] too"

More stuff about video games, anime, and broken relationships. It is honestly so surprising that these strangers on the internet open up about their problems and look for advice in the chat of lofi hiphop streams. Surprising, but refreshingly innocent and kind.
