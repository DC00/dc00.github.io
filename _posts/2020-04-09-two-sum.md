I'm going to try and do leetcode problems on a consistent basis. Here's one of the most common problems out there.

***

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```


**Solution With Dictionary**

We have to find the indices of two unique numbers which add up to the target value. Start with a for loop and look for the *complement* in the remaining list elements. Use ***enumerate()*** to be cool.

```
def two_sum(nums, target):
	dic = {}
	for i, num in enumerate(nums):
		complement = target - num
		if complement in dic:
			return [dic[complement], i]
		dic[complement] = i
```

Map the complement to its index in the given array with a dictionary. Average lookup time would then be `O(1)` and the outside look would run in `O(n)`
