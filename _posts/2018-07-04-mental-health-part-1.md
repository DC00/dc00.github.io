Fame is an expensive commodity these days. As foretold by [Dave Chapelle](https://youtu.be/ZOBjLPfDBWc?t=2m11s), the environment which produces celebrities might break them down at the same time. 

One example from Youtube is ElleOfTheMills. She recently [posted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKKwgq9LRgA&t=3s) about dealing with mental health issues regarding her accelerated rise to Youtube stardom. In the video, she explains how confusing it is to achieve her dream but feel unhappy at the same time.

Over on Barstool the topic of thick skin was discussed once again. The management at the company maintains that their special sauce is being edgy in today's mainstream news environment - edgy with objectively rude and crass insults in the name of views and clicks. One blogger, Nate, [explained](https://youtu.be/PQrosqG-J7g?t=10m14s) that if you can survive this environment it makes you "better."

I think it is easy to say that people just need a thicker skin to deal with the negativity that apparently comes with social fame. I also think a lot of people that go into an on-camera role believe that the work will make them better. A better and more famous celebrity, but probably not a better person.
